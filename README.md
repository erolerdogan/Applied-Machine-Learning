After training a ridge regression model, you find that the training and test set accuracies are 0.98 and 0.54 respectively. Which of the following would be the best choice for the next ridge regression model you train?

You are overfitting, the next model trained should have a higher value for alpha


##1
After training a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM, you decide to increase the influence of each training point and to simplify the decision surface. Which of the following would be the best choice for the next RBF SVM you train?

Decrease C, increase gamma


##2
Suppose you are interested in finding a parsimonious model (the model that accomplishes the desired level of prediction with as few predictor variables as possible) to predict housing prices. Which of the following would be the best choice?

Ridge Regression


##3
Which of the following is true of cross-validation? (Select all that apply)

Helps prevent knowledge about the test set from leaking into the model
Increases generalization ability and reduces computational complexity
Fits multiple models on different splits of the data
Removes need for training and test sets
Increases generalization ability and computational complexity
